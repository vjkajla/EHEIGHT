OPEN SOURCE DESIGN FOR SMART OUTDOOR POLE

Idea : 

A smart IOT pole which stores solar energy in li-ion battery and has the facility for lighting, security,digital display, sensors and mobile charging. Analytics and control on the web.

The Purpose : 

Green Street light: Solar energy is stored in the li-ion battery and LED light is used for lightning. this makes it can last for 10years which are the most innovative solution for street lighting.
Wireless :No external wire is needed for both power and connectivity. All the devices can be connected with IOT board which Connects with WI-FI internet. 
All inside: Devices and battery can be placed inside the pole, so no issue of damage from external weather conditions and theft.hence minimum maintenance cost. 
Smart City: This pole has sensors to collected outdoor data , digital display for real time infromation in outdoor. 


Technology : 

Li-ion battery solar charging: Sun is the source of energy and that energy is stored in li-ion cells ,cells have high energy density hence need less space and can be used in low and high temperature hence best choice for outdoor street poles. IOT: Texas instruments cc3200 board is used to sent data from pole to cloud and access data from the cloud, TI CC3200 is the single chip which has both iot and microcontroller cortex M4. A single web page is designed for all function hence easy management. Digital Display: The pole display can be used for alerts,emergency message,advertisement.
